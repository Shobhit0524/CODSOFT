# CODSOFT AI Internship Projects  

This repository contains the projects I developed during my **CodSoft AI Internship**, showcasing practical implementations of Artificial Intelligence concepts such as chatbots, game AI, and recommendation systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects  

### 1. Rule-Based Chatbot (`chatbot.py`)  
- A simple chatbot built using keyword-based matching and predefined rules.  
- Handles greetings, FAQs, and basic interactions.  
- Implements input normalization, keyword expansion, and fallback responses.  

**How to run:**  
```bash
python chatbot.py

### 2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI (tic_tac.py)

A command-line unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

Optimized for faster performance while maintaining perfect gameplay.

Demonstrates adversarial search and game theory in practice.

How to run:
python tic_tac.py

3. Recommendation System (reccomend.py)

A hybrid recommendation system combining Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering.

Suggests items based on user preferences and item similarity.

Demonstrates handling of challenges like sparsity and cold-start problems.

How to run:
python reccomend.py

ðŸš€ Key Learnings

-Bridged the gap between AI theory and practical implementation.
-Gained hands-on experience in debugging recursive algorithms and similarity computations.
-Learned to follow clean coding, modular design, and version control practices using GitHub.
-Understood how AI concepts are applied in real-world use cases like conversational bots, gaming, and personalized recommendations.


This project is part of my CodSoft AI Internship and is free to use for educational purposes.
